PostNPlay is a chatting webapp for roleplayers.  It features character profiles and chat and simple dice simulators.

It uses a Vue frontend and a ASP.NET/MySQL backend, and makes use of the MVC pattern with a repository layer.

This project was written as a group capstone for Boise CodeWork's Fall 2019 cohort over the course of a week.
